Hi, I am Yancan Chen, a graduate student in Department of Computer Science at National Univeristy of Singapore (NUS), supervised by Prof. [Yi-Chich Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/yclee/).

I am working on multi-modal model retrievals and Multi-agent system.

Project 
------
Medical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Knowledge Graph Construction
* Employ Noise Embedding methods on Word Embedding of Qwen2-7B, The F1 score increases by 1 precent point.
* Employ the KTO Reinforcement Learning (RL) to improve Nested Named Entity Recognition (Nested NER)
* Qwen2 does not support the XML Tag (e.g. <person>Yancan Chen</person>) entity annotation. By training with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Preferences (DPO), it can be endowed with this capability.
